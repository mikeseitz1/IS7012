    <p>
      Being a solutions and business outcome leader for global enterprise
      clients with deep experience in all aspects of IT Management, from
      architecture to audit and assessments, I am effective at building trusted
      working relationships with executive CxOs and line of business
      stakeholders. Having broad and deep hands-on technical experience in
      cloud, data center, systems engineering, and networks has afforded me the
      credibility to build robust IT organizations. Given my aptitude to adapt
      to new requirements, I have a strong knowledge of many IT standards, from
      ITIL to NIST. Because of the senior level of my capabilities, I have
      consistently been challenged with globally scaled situations requiring
      effective communication and coaching to achieve a superior business
      outcome.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a skilled and experienced CxO lead consultant and manager of
      large-scale IT Services, I incorporate the cross- functional capabilities
      of Business Analyst, Program Manager, and Sales and Solution lead. Years
      of managing technical and operational staff on a customer's behalf allow
      me to work across business, application, and IT teams (strategic to
      tactical) to address complex challenges. Achieving valued consultative
      in-budget business outcomes is my motivation to support senior
      stakeholders. Being the trusted advisor that fits between executive
      business pain points and IT solution delivery is an exhilarating universe.
      As a continuous learner, I keep abreast of the latest information
      technology and industry standards to be my clients' go-to trusted advisor.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additionally, I am experienced in Azure with a broad knowledge of all
      aspects of information cloud technology and hybrid operations. I've
      sponsored and personally led the design of global large-scale cloud
      migrations and legacy IT transformations supporting hundreds of
      applications and thousands of servers. I can quickly understand business
      problems from the client's eyes and translate them into innovative
      solutions to ensure the customers' desired business outcomes. Lastly, I am
      extraordinarily effective at reducing the cost of IT while increasing
      value to my customers' business because of my decades of experience
      consulting with senior leaders to develop, build, and run complex, secure
      IT at an enterprise scale, allowing me to reinforce driving business
      outcomes from business challenges.
